- Implemented a deep, RNN-based variational autoencoder for modeling the latent dynamics of high-dimensional time series data.
- Developed a novel regularization technique to prevent identity overfitting in autoencoders.
- Adapted and implemented a distributed hyperparameter optimization technique to automatically train and tune models in parallel across dozens of GPUs in local or managed clusters.
- Improved behavior decoding over previous SOTA approaches across 3 brain areas and 4 tasks.
- Co-first author publication in Nature Methods 2022.
- Co-first author publication in JOSS 2023.
