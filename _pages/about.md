I'm a freshly minted PhD graduate from the [machine learning program](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd) at Georgia Tech, in search of new opportunities in applied ML science and engineering. I am particularly excited about applications in wearables, health, and biotechnology.

My primary expertise is in principled design, implementation, and evaluation of deep learning architectures (recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, transformers, etc.) for high-dimensional time series and other sequential data types.

My dissertation research with Chethan Pandarinath in the [Systems Neural Engineering Lab](https://snel.gatech.edu/) developed more general, interpretable, and usable models for biological neural activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces.

I studied biomedical and electrical engineering at Clemson University after attending the SC Governor's School for Science and Math in Hartsville, SC. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, weight training, travel, and spending time outdoors.
