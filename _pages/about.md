I'm a PhD student in the interdisciplinary [machine learning program](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd) at Georgia Tech. I work with Chethan Pandarinath in the [Systems Neural Engineering Lab](https://snel.gatech.edu/), designing deep models that leverage the dynamical structure underlying neural population recordings. My most noteworthy projects include a framework for robust tuning of sequential autoencoders on neural data (AutoLFADS) and a training technique that increases the resolution of sparsely sampled neural data (selective backpropagation through time).

I majored in biomedical and electrical engineering at Clemson University after attending the SC Governor's School for Science and Math in Hartsville, SC. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, weight training, travel, and spending time outdoors.
